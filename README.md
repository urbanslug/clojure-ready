Clojure ready.
---


Some data that you need in projects but don't find in data representations
that you can work with right away so you have to convert to something Clojure
friendly.

Let's grow this thing. Send in PRs please.

Currently I think a dump (not a library) approach of data is enough but this
could change depending on user needs.
